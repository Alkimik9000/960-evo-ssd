# Android App

This directory contains a minimal Android application written in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose. It is intended to query a read-only GraphQL API hosted on your EC2 instance and to send webhook requests for task creation.

The project skeleton can be opened with Android Studio. Update the API endpoint and webhook URL within the code or a configuration screen.

Run the app using a Pixel 8 Pro emulator or device.
